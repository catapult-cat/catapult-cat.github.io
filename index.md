Cat (me). Friendly, patient and experienced teacher.

Child. Your child at the centre of what I offer.

## About Me

I was born in South London and spent my childhood growing up in a busy household, as my parents were foster carers for the Local Authority. Being an older sibling to over 100 foster brothers and sisters no doubt influenced my career path to become a teacher.

I completed my initial teacher training with Roehampton Institute of Education (now Roehampton University, London) and worked in several South London schools as a Primary school teacher from 2001 until 2014.

It was in 2014 that I embarked upon my Postgraduate training to become a Teacher of the Deaf. I qualified with a Distinction (accredited by University of Hertfordshire) and completed 4 Â½ years in a Secondary School setting specialist unit.

I have been fortunate enough to have had a teaching career surrounded by many great educators and more recently working in close partnership with associated specialists in health care such as Speech and Language Therapists, Paediatric Audiologists and Educational Phycologists.

I feel very lucky to have lived near to the schools where I have worked, giving me the valuable opportunity to build on shared experiences with pupils. This is the key factor in why I have always been particularly successful in engaging well with pupils.
